    iRobot has moved to the Prime line, so the 20 prefixes now in that
    table are effectively the whole set. Prime, by contrast, keeps
    gaining models. An SKU nobody recognises today is therefore far more
    likely to be a new Prime robot than a missed Classic one -- and

    step already documents: a plausible-looking choice that cannot work,

        regardless of local scan results.

        BUG FIX (this session): previously, zero discovered local
        devices fell straight through to async_step_manual() -- a dead
        end for a V4/Prime-only owner, since their robot never appears
        via local broadcast at all (no local channel exists). The
        cloud-account option is now shown unconditionally, not just
        appended to the dropdown when local devices happen to exist.

        REAL FIELD BUG FOUND AND FIXED (this session, chairstacker,
        with screenshots): V4/Prime robots DO still respond to the
        same local UDP discovery broadcast Classic robots use, even
        though they cannot actually be set up or controlled that way
        -- roombapy's own RoombaInfo.sku field is exactly what's
        needed to tell them apart (see _is_prime_sku() above), but
        this step wasn't using it at all. Two real consequences this
        fixes:

        1. A Prime device used to appear in the "Select robot" dropdown
           the same as a Classic one, showing its name and IP -- an
           entirely plausible-looking but non-functional choice.
           Picking it led into the local-link flow, which cannot work
           for this generation of robot at all. Now filtered out of
           the dropdown entirely -- the "Set up with my iRobot
           account" option (already labeled as being for exactly this
           case) remains the only way to add one.
        2. WORSE: if a Prime robot triggers a genuine HA-native zeroconf/
           DHCP discovery (self.host gets pre-set before this step even
           runs), the OLD code took a fast path straight into the
           local-link flow with no form shown at all -- the user never
           even got a choice, unlike the dropdown case above. Now
           redirects straight to the cloud-account flow instead in
           that specific case, since the SKU already confirms which
           path is actually needed -- no reason to show a form asking
           again when the answer is already known.

    # _async_setup()/_async_update_data() already raise ConfigEntryAuthFailed
    # on a bad cloud login (pre-dates v3.5.0) — which calls
    # config_entry.async_start_reauth(), which starts THIS flow at
    # async_step_reauth. That method didn't exist anywhere in this file, so
    # every auth failure since that mechanism was added would have silently
    # gone nowhere: no guided flow, just a config entry stuck in an error
    # state with no path back for the user except removing and re-adding the
    # whole integration. v3.5.0's cloud_stale split (repairs.py) explicitly
    # relies on this native reauth flow instead of a custom Repair Issue for
    # the auth-failure case — so this was the missing other half of that fix.
    #
    # Reuses the same validate-before-save pattern already established for
    # cloud credentials elsewhere in this file (async_step_cloud_credentials
    # above, and RoombaPlusOptionsFlow's version) rather than introducing a
    # third, slightly different implementation of the same check.
