        the two earlier ones below were both tried live and confirmed
        NOT working, kept here as historical record, not active code.

        make the robot chime, even though the equivalent action works
        fine from the real app.

        SECOND HYPOTHESIS -- ALSO DISPROVEN (chairstacker, real device
        test): the app's own command config names this feature's
        underlying command "SetEchoCommand" -- a shadow WRITE, not a
        REST POST, so roombapy-prime's
        PrimeRobot.trigger_echo_via_shadow() was tried as an

        accepted shadow update/delta came back), but the robot did NOT
        chime. Not wired in here -- it doesn't work either.
