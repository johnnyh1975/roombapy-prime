"""GridStore — EMA-weighted occupancy grid for Roomba+.

Sparse dict mapping (gx, gy) integer grid cells to float EMA weights.
Cell size: 150 mm. Coordinates are dock-relative (dock at origin).

EMA constants (validated during v2.2 with diagnostic attributes):
  DECAY           = 0.85  — weight of existing cell on each new mission
  VISIT_INCREMENT = 0.30  — weight added when robot visits a cell
  PRUNE_THRESHOLD = 0.05  — cells below this are removed from the dict

Stuck cells are tracked separately as a count dict {(gx, gy): int}.
A cell is a "stuck hotspot" when stuck_count >= STUCK_HOTSPOT_THRESHOLD.

Lifecycle: instantiate → async_load() → update per mission end → async_save().
No HA dependencies at import time beyond hass.storage — fully unit-testable.
