"""Repair fix flows for Roomba+.

HA calls async_create_fix_flow() when the user clicks Fix on a Repair Issue
that has is_fixable=True. The fix flow step_id MUST be "init" — the HA
repair frontend only routes form submissions for the "init" step. Any other
step_id causes the dialog to close immediately as "Problem resolved".

Zone IDs are read from config entry options["discovered_zone_ids"] rather
than from live robot state, because by the time the user clicks Fix the
robot's MQTT state may no longer contain regions (e.g. after a full clean
or a return-to-base mission).

    1. Implausible instantaneous jump in batPct (>= _BATPCT_JUMP_MIN_DELTA

       direction). No real battery changes charge state this fast — this
       is the BMS communication link dropping and recovering, not the
       battery itself. Debounced over _CONTACT_ANOMALY_DEBOUNCE consecutive
       occurrences to avoid firing on one isolated MQTT glitch — UNLESS
       (v3.5.0) bbchg.smberr is also elevated, in which case a single
       occurrence is enough (see _smberr_elevated() below): corroborating
       evidence from a second, independent field justifies acting sooner.

    2. The per-charge-cycle peak batPct declining over
       _CHARGE_PEAK_DECLINE_CYCLES consecutive charge cycles. Intermittent
       contact can reduce how much charge is actually transferred each
       cycle even when no single jump looks anomalous on its own — this
       catches the gradual version of the same underlying problem.

    merged into this one (and into async_check_dock_health) rather than
    just deleted — it was ~90% redundant with what these two already tell
    the user (clean contacts / consider battery replacement), but the
    signal itself is real corroborating evidence, so it now lowers this
    check's debounce and appears as context in the fired issue's text
    instead of firing its own separate issue for the same underlying
    problem. The raw bbchg.smberr count remains visible in diagnostics.

    phase, both universally present), unlike async_check_dock_health which

      - Auth failure (401/403 -> AuthenticationError): the coordinator's own
        _async_update_data()/_async_setup() already raise
        ConfigEntryAuthFailed on this, which HA turns into its own native
        reauth Repair Issue + guided flow automatically (see
        cloud_coordinator.py). This check must NOT also fire for that case
        — that would be two Repairs for one root cause, and HA's own is
        both more correct (guided reauth) and Gate-C actionable in a way a
        second, custom Repair wouldn't add anything to. Detected via
        cloud_coordinator.last_update_success is False AND last_exception
        is a ConfigEntryAuthFailed — see the bug-hunt note below for why
        both conditions matter, not just the second one.
      - Genuinely unreachable (network/cloud down, timeout): not something
        the user can act on beyond waiting, and typically transient — no
        longer a persistent, must-dismiss Repair; fires once per sustained
        occurrence via _fire_once() instead (Logbook + optional automation
        for anyone who wants to know).

    Bug-hunt fix: DataUpdateCoordinator.last_exception is sticky — HA never
    resets it to None on a later successful refresh (verified against HA's
    own _async_refresh: the success path only touches last_update_success).
    Checking last_exception alone would mean a single historical auth
    failure, resolved via reauth days ago, permanently suppresses this
    event for any later, unrelated genuine staleness. Gating on
    last_update_success is False too (the coordinator's CURRENT refresh
    cycle, not ever) fixes that: once a refresh succeeds again,
    last_update_success flips back to True regardless of what
    last_exception still holds, and this event resumes working normally.

    Called from _on_cloud_refresh_complete in __init__.py, which fires after
    every coordinator update regardless of success, so this check runs both
    when updates succeed (to re-arm) and when they fail (to fire).

    Distinct from WIFI-CLOUD-HEALTH (robot-side cloud disconnect) — this
    represents HA failing to fetch data, regardless of whether the robot
    itself can still reach iRobot servers.

    """maintenance_due Repair Issue (v2.9.0) — backstop for users without
    automations wired to the maintenance_due device trigger / binary_sensor.

    Unlike integration_health's sustained-duration gate (which exists to
    reject a noisy, fluctuating signal), hours-since-reset is monotonic —
    once a consumable is due it STAYS due until reset, it never flickers.
    The MAINTENANCE_DUE_GRACE_DAYS delay here is purely about not nagging
    the user in the Repairs UI for a marginal, just-crossed-the-threshold
    overage (the hour thresholds are heuristics, not safety-critical) — the
    binary_sensor and device trigger already give instant awareness to
    anyone who wants it via automation; this is the UI-visible backstop for
    everyone else.

    due_items is the live list from RoombaMaintenanceDue._due_items() (e.g.
    ["filter", "brush"]) — passed in directly rather than recomputed here,
    since the binary sensor entity already has vacuum_state/options/store
    wired and recomputing the same logic a second time would risk the two
    silently diverging.

    Note: the "since" timestamp tracks since ANY item first became due, not
    per-component — if the user resets one overdue consumable while another
    remains due, the timer does not restart. Coarser than ideal, but matches
    the same simplicity tradeoff already accepted for _health_low_since.
