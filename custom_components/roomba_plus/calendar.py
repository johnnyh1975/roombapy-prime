"""Calendar platform for Roomba+.

v3.4.0 CAL — `calendar.roomba_*_schedule`: the robot's iRobot-app
cleaning schedule (cleanSchedule2 for i/s/j-series, legacy
cleanSchedule for 900/600-series) rendered as recurring HA Calendar
events. Read-only (reduced scope, Nutzersicht-Review Juli 2026) — no
create/update/delete support, and no separate mission-history calendar
(that would be a third rendering of data Logbook and the Card's
History tab already cover).

Always created, regardless of robot tier (CAL plan §3 decision):
scheduling is a software feature virtually every iRobot model supports,
unlike map-dependent platforms (image.py) that need real hardware
capability. An empty calendar (no schedule set yet) is normal,
well-supported HA behaviour, not an error state.

All parsing lives in schedule_parser.py, shared with sensor_core.py's
sensor.*_next_clean — see that module's docstring for why it's kept
separate from both platforms rather than one importing the other.

REAL UX GAP FOUND AND FIXED (later session): every event previously
showed a bare "Cleaning" summary regardless of tier, even though
SMART-tier (i/s/j-series) cleanSchedule2 entries carry a region
reference (cmd.regions) the SAME way SmartZoneSelect/zone_naming.py
already use to discover known zones — this data was always present,
just discarded here since this module originally only extracted time
occurrences. EPHEMERAL-tier (legacy cleanSchedule, 900/600-series)
genuinely has no region concept at all (no persistent map), so those
robots keep the plain "Cleaning" summary — not a remaining gap, a
correct reflection of what that tier can express. SMART-tier entries
that don't happen to reference a region (e.g. an explicit "whole
house" entry) also keep the plain summary, for the same reason.
