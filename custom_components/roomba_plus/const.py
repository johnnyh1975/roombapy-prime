# A connectivity/error sensor is planned (see
# NEW (this session): sensor.py now has a dedicated CLOUD_ONLY branch
# (sensor_prime.py) -- no longer "not-yet-built".
#
# BUG FOUND AND FIXED (later same session): binary_sensor.py's own
# CLOUD_ONLY entities (PrimeBinPresentSensor/PrimeTankPresentSensor/
# PrimeRobotConnectivitySensor) and switch.py's PrimeCarpetBoostSwitch
# were built and tested in isolation, but this list was never updated
# to include their platforms -- meaning HA never actually called
# either module's async_setup_entry() for a CLOUD_ONLY config entry,
# so none of these entities were ever created for a real user despite
# working code existing for them. Caught by reviewing a real field
# tester's own screenshots, which only ever showed sensor.py entities,
# never any of these.
#
# SECOND, BIGGER BUG FOUND AND FIXED (this session, caught by a new
# structural test built specifically to prevent a THIRD occurrence of
# this exact pattern -- test_prime_platform_coverage.py's own backward
# check): image.py's PrimeMapImage (the live cleaning map) has had a
# real, working CLOUD_ONLY branch since v4.0.0a0/a1 -- Platform.IMAGE
# was NEVER in this list at all, meaning the live map has been

# NEW (V4/Prime): stores ConnectionType.value ("local_push"/"cloud_only") in

# Options keys (Phase 2+)
#: Whether to draw room names INTO the room map image.
#:
#: BOTH GENERATIONS. Briefly named prime_* while only the Prime map
#: existed, and renamed the same day -- it had never shipped, so there
#: was no preference to preserve and no reason to keep a name that
#: describes half of what it does.
#:
#: Defaults to False, which looks backwards until you know what Classic
#: does: it removed its own labels in v2.7.3 precisely because the
#: xiaomi-vacuum-map-card renders its own overlay from the `rooms`
#: attribute, and drawing both doubles them up.
#:
#: So the default suits the card user, and the option exists for
#: everyone else -- somebody using a plain picture-entity card, or a
#: dashboard where the map is just an image, gets nothing from an
#: attribute nobody reads. For them the labels have to be in the picture
#: or they do not exist.
#:
#: The attributes are published either way -- for Classic through
#: `rid_to_name()`, for Prime through the map metadata. This only
#: controls the image.
#: Whether to create one button per saved favourite.
#:
#: On by default. The buttons are the only route that needs no
#: configuration at all -- after installing, a favourite is there and
#: tappable, and it works with voice assistants, which a service call
#: does not.
#:
#: The option exists because they are also the only route that costs an
#: entity each. An account with fifteen favourites gets fifteen entities
#: on the device page, and someone driving everything from automations
#: has the `favorites` attribute and the run_favorite service instead --
#: both of which key on the favourite ID and therefore survive a rename
#: in the iRobot app.

# millimetres as every consumer in this codebase previously assumed (the
# "_mm" suffix on variables throughout image.py/callbacks.py/map_renderer.py/
# grid_store.py/zone_store.py was an unverified naming assumption, never
# checked against real hardware). Evidence: a real mid-mission checkpoint
# showed pose data confined to an apparent ~0.7m x 0.75m pocket; the user
# confirmed the robot had in fact covered roughly half of a 106 m² home by
# that point. Multiplying the raw pose values by 10 (cm -> mm) gives
# 7.0m x 7.5m = 52.5 m^2 = 49.5% of 106 m^2 — matching the user's own
# estimate almost exactly. This also explains why GAP_THRESHOLD_MM (800) /
# MIN_DOOR_WIDTH_MM (600) / MAX_DOOR_WIDTH_MM (1200) in zone_store.py could
# essentially never fire correctly: real ~600-1200mm door gaps were
# arriving as ~60-120 raw units, an order of magnitude under threshold.
# Apply this factor at every point pose.point.x/y is first read from the

# V4-SKU-VERIFY (July 2026) — "g" added separately: the first, and so far

# accounts (chairstacker, jadestar1864 — both a Roomba 405 Combo, SKU
# G185020, different households). NOT the same thing as the pre-existing "c"
# prefix above: "c" comes from the Classic app's own config file and predates
# any V4/Prime work in this project — whether it refers to the same physical
# product family as "g" is not established, so the two are kept distinct
# rather than merged on the assumption they mean the same "Combo". No
# ROBOT_PROFILES entry for "g" yet — no real battery/maintenance-interval
# field data has been collected for this SKU, only login/state confirmation
# via roombapy-prime (see roombapy-prime's CHANGELOG v0.1.2a0/fifty-sixth

        "i755840"  → ROBOT_PROFILES["i"]   (i-series)
        "R980040"  → ROBOT_PROFILES["9"]   (900-series, note: "R" is not "9"!)
        "s955840"  → ROBOT_PROFILES["s"]   (s9-series)

    Note: some iRobot SKUs start with "R" for 900-series (e.g. "R980040").
    These are handled by the "r" → "9" alias below.

    battery_type — when provided (from the live MQTT ``batteryType`` field),
    overrides the profile's default ``battery_chemistry``.  This matters for
    900-series robots where the OEM Li-Ion pack may have been replaced with an
    aftermarket NiMH pack (or vice-versa).  The profile always stores both
    ``estcap_scale_liion`` and ``estcap_scale_nimh``; only the active chemistry
    selector needs to be updated so battery-related sensors pick the right
    scale factor.

    Example: Roomba 980 with aftermarket NiMH battery →
        battery_type="nimh", profile default="lipo"
        → returned profile has battery_chemistry="nimh"
        → battery_capacity_retention uses estcap_scale_nimh (1.87×) ✅

#     "pause", not "stop" -- there is no confirmed "stop" event_type at

#     confirmed physical arrival at the dock (dock was commanded right

# signal that can hang a real mission end forever is worse than the
