"""Config entry migrations, one per schema version.

MOVED OUT OF __init__.py (this session). It had grown to 2,145 lines --
roughly sixty percent of that file -- and pushed the actual setup and
teardown logic far enough down that reading either meant scrolling past
the other.

Migrations are the one part of an integration that only ever grows:
every historical version's migration has to stay forever, because
somebody out there is still on it. Keeping that permanent, monotonically
growing body in the same file as the code that changes most often makes
both harder to work with.

Nothing about the migrations themselves changed in the move -- same
function, same version history, same behaviour. __init__.py re-exports
it so Home Assistant's own lookup of `async_migrate_entry` on the
integration module keeps working unchanged.

    Version history:
      1 → 2 (v2.0):   Cloud coordinator now stores raw mission records alongside
                      aggregates. A marker key is added to options so the coordinator
                      knows to persist raw_records on its next fetch. All existing
                      user data (zone names, maintenance baselines, blocking/presence
                      config) is preserved unchanged. MissionStore hass.storage data
                      is unaffected — it is keyed by entry_id, not entry version.
      2 → 3 (v2.1.0): MaintenanceStore gains baseline_estcap and consecutive_skips.
      3 → 4 (v2.1.1): Entity unique_ids normalised — 37 entities renamed from
                      German slugs to English slugs in the entity registry so that
                      automations, history, and the Lovelace card are unaffected.
      9 → 10 (v2.1.1): Fix swapped completion_rate entity_ids.
      13 → 14 (v2.5.0): Fix locale-dependent entity_id slugs for signal_noise,
                        mission_recharge_time, and mission_expire_time sensors
                        (added in v2.4.3 with translation_key; German installs
