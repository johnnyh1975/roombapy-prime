"""v3.3.0 MISSION-MAP — per-mission coverage fetch + compositor.

Fetch half: `async_fetch_mission_map()` is the ONE reusable, verified
code path from a MissionStore record to that mission's coverage layers —
deliberately not REST-handler internals, so the future incremental
GridStore aggregator (GS-SMART-COVERAGE backlog candidate) reuses the
same verify-gated fetch instead of growing a second one.

Render half: `render_mission_map_png()` — stateless compositor for
finished missions. `map_renderer.py` stays the live-mission machine
(point buffers, dock anchor, checkpoints); a completed mission only
needs room outlines + coverage points, so this is a pure function that
imports the renderer's style constants (one style, two consumers).

Data chain (field-verified, boutXIII RESEARCH-MISSIONMAP + V2):
record.pmaps_info -> (pmap_id, pmapv_id of THIS mission)
-> cloud get_pmap_umf(activeDetails=2)
-> maps[0].map_header verifies nmssn against the record
-> layers[coverage].geometry: multipoint2d coordinates (m) + point_area.
