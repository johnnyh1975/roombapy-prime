"""Room-targeted cleaning, for both robot generations.

WHY A FACADE RATHER THAN A BRANCH IN services.py.

Four services clean named rooms: clean_room, clean_overdue_rooms,
auto_clean_dirty_rooms and smart_start. All four ask the same two
questions -- "what rooms exist and what are they called" and "clean
these rooms" -- and both generations can answer both.

They just answer differently. Classic reads regions off its cloud
coordinator and sends pmap_id/region ids; Prime reads rooms_metadata
off a map and sends p2map_id/region_id plus an initiator. Branching on
that inside each service would put the same two-way decision in four
places, which this project has already paid for once: vacuum.py carried
four identical copies of one transport branch, and a fix that belonged
in one of them went into the wrong one.

So the services ask a backend, and the backend knows which generation
it is. Adding a third generation later touches this file and nothing
else.

A SECOND THING THIS SETTLES. Room cleaning used to be gated on
`map_capability == SMART`, which is a Classic concept -- it describes
whether a Classic robot has persistent pmaps. Prime robots leave it at
NONE (has_smart_map() looks for a "pmaps" key; Prime reports "p2maps"),
so every Prime robot was refused room cleaning even after the transport
was confirmed working on real hardware.

Rather than redefining that flag -- it is read in 32 places across seven
modules, many of them Classic cloud paths that do not exist for Prime --
the question becomes "is there a backend for this robot". Absence of a
backend is the honest answer to "can this robot clean a named room",
and it needs no flag to be interpreted correctly at 32 call sites.

        backend that reorders them silently discards that work.

        `ordered` asks the robot to visit them in that sequence rather
        than picking its own route.

        `two_pass` is per room and positional, aligned with room_ids;
        None means "whatever the robot is already set to". A first draft
        of this interface took only room_ids, which would have thrown
        away a capability the Classic path has always had -- and which
        Prime turns out to support identically (the confirmed field
        payload carries twoPass per region).

        `suction_level` is per room as well, and PRIME ONLY -- the
        Classic room payload has no equivalent. A backend that cannot
        honour it ignores it rather than failing, so a caller need not
        know which generation it is talking to.

        DELIBERATELY NOT OFFERED: operatingMode, which the confirmed
        Prime payload also carries. It relates to the fitted mop pad,
        and the compatibility rule lives robot-side where this code
        cannot check it -- our own diagnostic script says as much when
        it reports the value. Exposing a setting whose valid range we
        cannot determine invites a service call that is silently
        rejected, or worse, accepted and wrong. It stays out until
        somebody establishes what the values mean.

        UPDATE (30 July 2026): the values are now known, from a
        chairstacker map-edit response that returned the full
        p2map_metadata. Each room carries operating_mode_defaults keyed
        by mode, plus a last_operating_mode:

            2   -> profile "normal"
            4   -> profile "normal" (seen only with carpetBoost + swScrub)
            32  -> profile "light"
            512 -> profile "deep"  (suctionLevel 4, twoPass, swScrub 1)

        Still not offered, and the reason has changed. It is no longer
        "we do not know the range" but "the robot already stores a
        per-room default for each mode, including which one was used
        last". Overriding that from a service call would discard a
        preference the user set in the iRobot app, per room, and there is
        no way to put it back.

        The useful feature here is not an operating_mode parameter -- it
        is READING these defaults, so a service call can honour what the
        user configured rather than replace it. Not built yet, and
        deliberately noted rather than guessed at.

        live here briefly and was removed, because comparing the two

          - the 141-line resolution step, including cross-map conflict
            rules for duplicate room names
          - the "map is currently updating" readiness check

            regions and zones
          - the distinct "no rooms configured yet" error, which tells a
            user what to do rather than just failing

        A copy that looks finished and is not is worse than no copy:
        whoever finds it later may switch the service over to it and
        lose all four without noticing.

        Moving it properly is worthwhile and is its own task. It touches
        a path real users depend on daily, and it should not ride along
        with adding a new generation -- one working generation at a time

        """HA Clean Area segments, which are NOT the same as room ids.

        MOVED VERBATIM from vacuum.py (this session), with two entity
        attributes rebound: `self.vacuum` and `self.vacuum_state` are
        conveniences IRobotEntity provides, and they resolve here to
        `self._data.roomba` and `roomba_reported_state()` -- the same
        objects by a different route.

        Both were missed by the mechanical rewrite that moved this and
        were caught by existing tests. Worth naming: a move that renames
        `data.` to `self._data.` looks complete and silently leaves
        anything that was reached another way. Kept as its own
        method rather than folded into clean_rooms(), because Classic
        segments carry three things room ids do not:

          - a pmap_id prefix, so segments from another map can be
            recognised and skipped rather than sent to the wrong map
          - a "zid_" marker separating user-drawn ZONES from named
            rooms; both clean, through different payload fields
          - self-healing: a room id that no longer exists on the current
            map is looked up again by its stored name, because a retrain
            renumbers rooms and would otherwise break every saved area
            mapping silently

        None of that has a Prime equivalent, which is why PrimeRoom-
        Cleaning implements this as a thin decode of its own prefix.

        An earlier plan was to drop this into clean_rooms() and lose the
        distinction. That would have quietly removed zone cleaning and
        the self-healing from every Classic user -- the same shape of
        mistake as an earlier draft here that dropped four capabilities
        while "moving" code that it was actually rewriting.
