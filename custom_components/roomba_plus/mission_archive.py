"""MissionArchive — CloudMissionArchive for Roomba+ (v2.8.0 ARC1).

Persistent 3-layer history of all cloud missions:

  Layer 1 — Derived Record (ALL missions, newest first)
    26 computed signals extracted from raw /missionhistory records.
    ~450 bytes/mission.  Used by: BAT-ARCH sensors, L5-ARC, L3-ARC,
    GS-SMART-UMF bootstrapping, REST API format=export.

  Layer 2 — Compact Event Timeline (ALL missions, parallel list to Layer 1)
    Ordered sequence of finEvent summaries (type, minimal data).
    ~300 bytes/mission.  Used by: traversal detection (GS-SMART-UMF),
    room-sequence analytics, mission replay endpoint (v4.1.0).

  Layer 3 — Raw finEvents (anomalous missions only, ~30%)
    Full finEvents list for post-mortem diagnosis.
    ~3–5 KB/record.  Gated by _is_anomalous().
    Keyed by nMssn (int) for O(1) lookup.

Storage:
  - File: .storage/roomba_plus_mission_archive_{entry_id}
  - Format: {"version": 1, "last_nMssn": int,
              "derived": [...], "timeline": [...], "raw": {nMssn: [...]}}
  - MAX_RECORDS = 800 (≈2 years at 1 clean/day).  FIFO when exceeded.
  - Derived + Timeline are co-indexed: derived[i] ↔ timeline[i].

Lifecycle (callers must respect):
  - async_load()          — call once per async_setup_entry before any query
  - async_initial_load()  — one-time paginated back-fill (background task)
  - async_delta_update()  — call after each cloud mission record arrives
  - async_save()          — called internally; callers need not call directly

GS-SMART-UMF:
  After ARC1 is deployed the GS-QUICK bridging patch (v2.7.1) becomes
  redundant: traversal_missions() returns all history, so the ≥3 mission
  gate is always satisfiable for any robot with a complete cloud history.

        # every single cloud refresh whenever the upstream caller re-feeds
        # the last ~100 cloud history records (it does — this function is
        # NOT only called once per genuinely-new mission, despite the
        # docstring; observed in the field re-feeding the same window on
        # every refresh), and that window's oldest entry routinely sits
        # below the high-water mark simply because it's an older,
        # legitimately-never-archived gap-filler — not a reset at all.
        # That false trigger cleared _archived_nmssns (every refresh,
        # forever) while leaving _derived untouched, so every
        # already-archived record in the re-fed window got silently
        # RE-appended as a duplicate, unboundedly, on every single
        # refresh (confirmed in the field: 109 -> 209 -> 309 records
        # across two refreshes ~83 min apart, same robot).
        #
        # ROUND 2 (caught while writing the regression test for round 1):
        # requiring nMssn to ALSO already be in _archived_nmssns is not
        # enough either — an ordinary re-delivery of an already-archived
        # OLDER record (ANY record below the current high-water mark,
        # which is the common case once the archive holds more than one
        # mission) satisfies that exact same compound condition, since
        # its value is both lower than last_nMssn AND already archived.
        # That's not a reset, it's just a duplicate.
        #
        # nMssn alone — at any single value, in any combination — cannot

        # mark, possibly already seen before". The only available signal
