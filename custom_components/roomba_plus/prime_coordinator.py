"""V4/Prime cloud coordinator for Roomba+.

Native async push coordinator for V4/Prime (cloud-only, ConnectionType.
CLOUD_ONLY) robots -- see ROOMBA_PLUS_VERSION_PLAN_v4_onwards.md for the
full architecture context and the reasoning behind this design (in
particular, why this is NOT the same shape as IrobotCloudCoordinator's
polling model, and why an earlier "make PrimeRobot look like a classic
Roomba object" design was considered and rejected).

Unlike IrobotCloudCoordinator (cloud_coordinator.py), this is NOT a
polling coordinator: there is no update_interval, no
_async_update_data(). Data arrives via roombapy-prime's
PrimeRobot.watch_mission_timeline() -- an AsyncIterator that yields on
every real mission-timeline event, reconnecting transparently across
connection drops with its own exponential backoff (roombapy-prime
v0.1.11a3+). This coordinator only needs to consume it and forward each
report via async_set_updated_data() -- it does not need its own
reconnect/retry logic layered on top.

UPDATE (roombapy-prime v0.1.11a5): this coordinator used to consume
watch_state() (the classic shadow delta channel) instead -- switched
after a live capture (chairstacker) proved the shadow's reported state
is byte-identical whether the robot is idle or actively cleaning. Live
mission status genuinely does not flow through that channel at all;
mission/timeline/report is the confirmed source instead. coordinator.data
is now a parsed MissionTimelineReport (roombapy_prime.models), not a raw
dict -- the event schema is confirmed live (see MissionTimelineReport's
own docstring), so there's no reason to keep it untranslated the way
the old shadow-delta placeholder was.

STILL NOT A COMPLETE STATE FACADE ON ITS OWN: mission/timeline/report
gives room/mission progress (which room, area, timestamps), not
battery level or docking boolean state -- see vacuum.py's activity
property for how the confirmed event types are used to approximate a
VacuumActivity, and its own caveats about which mappings are
live-confirmed vs. only historically-confirmed. Battery/dock/bin/tank
status IS confirmed and modeled now, from a DIFFERENT named-shadow
source -- see PrimeStatusCoordinator below, a separate coordinator for
exactly that data, not folded into this one.

    screenshots showing the exact failure): AWS IoT Device Shadow's
    own "update/accepted" messages echo back ONLY the fields that
    were actually part of that specific update -- NOT the shadow's
    full current reported state (well-documented AWS behavior, and
    directly confirmed by this exact bug: starting a mission caused
    "ro-currentstate" to receive a small update, presumably just its
    own mission-status sub-fields, and every OTHER already-known
    ro-currentstate field -- detected_pad, dock, runtime_stats, and
    more -- simultaneously went to Unknown; meanwhile rw-settings,
    which received no update at all during that window, correctly
    kept showing its real, seeded value throughout, proving the
    connection/push mechanism itself was fine the whole time).

    A plain dict replacement (this function's own predecessor) treats
    each update as if it were the complete state, discarding every
    previously-known field the new update doesn't happen to mention.
    This merges recursively instead -- new keys/values are added or
    overwritten at whatever depth they appear at, but any existing
    key NOT present in the new update is preserved untouched, at
    every level of nesting (not just the shadow's own top level).

    SECOND REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED IN THIS SAME FUNCTION (chairstacker,
    a later report): battery specifically still went to "Unknown"
    immediately on mission start, even with the fix above in place --
    the exact same "explicit null vs missing key" class of bug this
    project has hit 12+ times elsewhere (dict.get(key, default) only
    guards a MISSING key, not a PRESENT key whose value is explicitly
    null). A mission-start update apparently includes "batPct": null
    explicitly, rather than omitting the key -- likely the shadow's own
    way of saying "no fresh reading yet for this field in THIS
    particular update", not "this value is now genuinely unknown". The
    loop below now treats an explicit null the same as a missing key
    when a real existing value is already present -- new information
    always wins, but null is never treated as new information capable
    of clobbering a real one.

    CONSIDERED, NOT ACTED ON (no confirmed field evidence either way,
    unlike the null case above): the same "no new info in this update"
    signal COULD in principle also show up as an empty list rather
    than an explicit null for a list-typed field (this project's own
    models confirm exactly one such field, CurrentStateShadow.p2maps)
    -- an empty list overwriting a previously non-empty one would lose
    data the same way null did for batPct. Deliberately NOT guarded
    against here: unlike null, an empty list is also a genuinely
    plausible REAL value (e.g. "no pending maps right now"), so
    guarding it without confirmed evidence risks the opposite mistake
    -- refusing to accept a real, legitimate emptying. If p2maps (or
    any other list field) is ever observed reverting to a stale,
    non-empty value the way battery did, this is the first place to

    CurrentStateShadow.from_json(coordinator.data.get("ro-currentstate", {}))
    themselves when reading their own value, the same way
    PrimeMissionEventSensor already reads PrimeCoordinator's own
    MissionTimelineReport. Kept generic and shadow-agnostic here so
    adding a sensor for a DIFFERENT shadow later (e.g. ro-stats'
    lifetime battery-cycle counters) never needs this coordinator
    itself touched again -- only the seed-fetch list below, if a new
    shadow is added to it.

    Seeded via ALL EIGHT NAMED shadows fetched once at startup (not just
    ro-currentstate) specifically BECAUSE watch_named_shadows_updates()
    is a single "+" wildcard covering every named shadow already --
    the push side receives updates for all of them regardless, so
    seeding only one and discarding the rest of what the SAME
    subscription delivers would be wasteful and would need redoing
    the moment a second shadow's data becomes a sensor.

    NOT a polling coordinator (update_interval=None), but unlike
    PrimeCoordinator, this data source needs an explicit seed:
    watch_named_shadows_updates() only delivers updates going forward
    (nothing arrives until a shadow's reported state next changes), so
    async_start() does the seed-fetch first -- this coordinator would
    otherwise report no data at all until the first live change on
    each shadow, which could be a long wait for a slowly-changing
    value like battery percentage.

    watch_named_shadows_updates() itself is a genuinely new,
    NOT-YET-LIVE-TESTED mechanism as of this writing (see its own
    docstring in roombapy-prime) -- reasoned and safety-checked (a
    single-level "+" wildcard on update/accepted, confirmed distinct
    from the multi-level "#" wildcard already ruled out elsewhere),
    but the FIRST real confirmation that named shadows push updates
    via this specific channel is still pending. If it turns out they
    don't push updates this way in practice, this coordinator would
    silently stay at its seed values forever, with no error -- worth
    watching for in practice, not yet confirmed either way.

    It asks rarely. Consumables move on a scale of hours of runtime; a

    never called it. That is a gap on our side rather than a protocol
    limitation.

    NOTE ON WHAT THIS IS NOT: Classic robots compute consumable wear
    themselves, in maintenance_store.py, because the robot reports
    nothing about it -- including learning your real replacement
    interval after a couple of resets. None of that applies here. Prime
    robots are simply told the answer by the cloud, so this coordinator
