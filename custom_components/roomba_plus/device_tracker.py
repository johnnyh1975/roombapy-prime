"""Device tracker platform for Roomba+.

v2.9.0 DEVICE-TRACKER. Tier-aware location reporting via TrackerEntity's
location_name (which HA's own state property checks BEFORE falling back to
lat/lon zone lookups — see homeassistant.components.device_tracker.config_entry
.TrackerEntity.state). Returning a named string here means NO fake GPS
coordinates are needed at all; HA core was already built for exactly this
"named location, not a map point" use case for an indoor robot.

- SMART robots (i/s/j-series, Braava m6): current room name during an
  active mission — reuses sensor.py's _resolve_smart_tier_room_state(),
  the SAME function RoombaMissionProgress's current_room attribute uses,
  so the two entities always agree.
- EPHEMERAL robots (900-series, e.g. the 980): room/zone-level detection
  is NOT yet wired in here. ZoneStore's gap-based zone splitting (the
  original room-detection mechanism) was found structurally limited for
  robots with dense MQTT pose sampling (confirmed: max inter-sample step
  340mm, far short of the 800mm door-gap threshold — see project notes,
  June 2026) and has since been removed entirely (ROOM-SEG, see
  ROOM_SEGMENTATION_NOTES.md). RoomSegStore (watershed segmentation on
  GridStore) replaced it for room naming/the live map, and could in
  principle fill this extension point too — resolving "which room is the
  robot in right now" from RoomSegStore's room cells + live pose is a
  reasonable next step, just not implemented yet. Deliberately
  isolated in its own function (_resolve_ephemeral_tier_room) so that once
  EPHEMERAL room/zone detection improves, only that one function needs to
  change — nothing else in this platform.

Both tiers: "Angedockt" while docked/idle (NOT "home" — the robot is
always physically at home regardless of dock state; "home" carries a
GPS-zone connotation that doesn't fit here). Raw x_mm/y_mm pose
coordinates are always exposed as attributes (when available) regardless
of tier, for users who want to build their own zone logic externally.
